# GDuplicateFinder - A **FREE** Groovy way to find file duplicates!

Unlike other duplicate finders such as Easy Duplicate File Finder,
Auslogics Duplicate File Finder, MindGems Fast Duplicate File Finder,
Duplicate Cleaner, DupFiles and others, GDuplicateFinder is a FREE cross-platform
application, with the ability to search among not just local files, but files on
the network, such as a Windows or a Linux share using VFS library.

Taking advantage of Groovy facilities and GPars power to process in parallel,
GDuplicateFinder will help you get rid of those duplicates you always
wanted to dispose in an easy and friendly way.

If you feel like contributing with code, you can always fork this [repo](https://github.com/guicamest/GDuplicate-Finder). Gradle will help
you configure the Eclipse project for you. You can also suggest improvements.

If you don't feel like coding but want to donate some money, you can do that using [paypal](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=fezuqqg9t6j6y).

## How to build
Required gradle version >= 1.0-rc-1

Requires Java >= 1.6

On root folder *GDuplicateFinder* run `gradle distZip`.
Script will automatically detect your system's os.
You can change the os by running `gradle -Pos=$osname`
where $osname can be one of the following:
windows32, windows64, linux32, linux64, maccocoa32 or maccocoa64.

## How to run

Requires Java >= 1.6

Get the build corresponding to your system from https://sourceforge.net/projects/gdupfinder/files/ 
and unzip GDuplicateFinder-2.0.3.zip

On windows run: `bin/FileDuplicateFinderUI.bat`

If you are on Mac or linux, run: `bin/FileDuplicateFinderUI`

## Troubleshooting

### Linux

If you are getting *Unable to locate theme engine in module_path: "pixmap"*
you should install **gtk2-engines-pixbuf** package.

On an Ubuntu distribution just run `sudo apt-get install gtk2-engines-pixbuf`

### Cannot load 64-bit SWT libraries

If you are getting *Exception in thread "main" java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: Cannot load 64-bit SWT libraries on 32-bit JVM*
it means your default java installation is 32-bit. You can verify it opening a console and typing *java -version*.
To fix it, either install 64-bit java and set it as default or download the 32-bit version of GDuplicateFinder.

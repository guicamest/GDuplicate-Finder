GDuplicateFinder HOW TO (thx to PFG)
-------------------------------------
Extract ZIP folder contents to a new folder.

Under extracted bin folder, find the file named 'FileDuplicateFinderUI.bat' if your OS is Windows or 'FileDuplicateFinderUI' if you are on Linux or Mac OS X.

Double-click on this to run the file. It will open a Command Prompt, and then open the main application screen from where you can customize your search.

Select the drive and folders you wish to search, and other parameters such as minimum file size. (I found it worth starting
at a relatively large minimum file size, and working downwards, otherwise the search takes longer and presents you with a massive search list.)

The search results show you the locations of duplicate files.
Select the files you want to delete by ticking the box next to the file name, then click on Delete Duplicates.
You will immediately be told which files have been deleted, and any duplicated files that you didn't select for deletion will remain visible in the original search list. - so you can part-complete a job, click on Delete duplicates, and it will clear out the ones you've selected and leave the remainder for you to carry on with later.

You can also right click on any file and choose to select/deselect all files on the file's folder. If you want to add another folder files for deletion, you can use multi-batch-select mode.
